        I am a 3rd year computer science student at Pertamina University. Eager
        to learn, explore, and take on challenges in new things. I like to be
        acquainted with new people and work as a team. I ve learned to
        acknowledge both of my capabilities and limitations (self-awareness)
        through the academic and nonacademic activities.
